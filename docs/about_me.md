**David Dada** manages MachineSight blog. He is a 4th year student of the department of Mechatronics Engineering, at Federal University of Technology, Minna (FUT, Minna). At a tender age, his passion for technology shines as he crafts devices; from wind turbines to toy aircraft (Though it never flew 😅). He now decides to specialize in Computer Vision. 

He is a Lifelong Learner who always attempt to fathom the depth, height and everything there is in any subject of interest. Aside technology, he enjoys riding and hand juggling.
