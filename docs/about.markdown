**MachineSight** brings you the intrinsics of Computer Vision. Bore out of the desire to contribute to CV/AI, it is purposed to give in-depth explanation and insights into the world of technology. No fancy web design or superflous element, just a minimalist style to ensure easy access and focus on functionality. 

This is a work-in-progress; stay tuned for amazing developments. Should you find bugs, error in posts or extremely "almost but not quite" moments, feel free to reach out to [me.](/about_me) I'd appreciate all feedbacks. The aim here is to learn!

Thanks for reading! Hope to keep seeing you around.
